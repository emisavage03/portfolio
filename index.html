Really all I felt was falsely strong. I held on tight and closed my eyes. It was dumb. I had no sense of your size. It was dumb to hold so tight. But last night on your birthday in the kitchen my grip was loose. My eyes were open. I felt your shape. I heard you breathing.</a>

    <p>Good morning world! I am Emi Savage. I am a media artist and undergrad student based in
        Los Angeles. Through
        integrating emerging technology and sensory experience, I make work that draws you in to the body, the past, and
        the natural world. My disciplines include creative code, projection, installation, graphic design, and video.
        <br><br> I am currently attending the <a href="https://map.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Media Arts + Practice</a>
        program at the University of Southern California. In
        my free time, I like to collect CDs and feel the sun on my back.
        <br><br>This portfolio site is <a href="https://github.com/emisavage03/portfolio" target="_blank">open source</a> and
        handcoded with <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/"
