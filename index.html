    </h1>

    <p>good morning world! welcome to my website. My name is Emmeline Savage (I go by Emi), and I like making things that draw you in to the body and to the past and to the natural world.
My practice covers a myriad of disciplines–creative code, illustration, video, design–but throughout all my projects I focus on exploration, experimentation, and authenticity with a sense of childlike joy and curiosity.
I am currently earning my Bachelor’s Degree at the University of Southern California in Media Arts + Practice, a program in the School of Cinematic Arts that cultivates critical media-making and multi-platform storytelling in the digital age.
When not at my laptop, I like to dig my hands in the dirt and feel the sun on my back.</p>
